## Installation

### Local Setup

1. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**

```sh
make venv
make install-packages
```

2. **Make migrations and migrate the database:**

```sh
make makemigrations
make migrate
```

3. **Run the application locally:**

```sh
make run-local
Make migrations and migrate the database:
```

### Docker Setup
Install Docker and Docker Compose if you haven't already.
(Install Docker)[https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/]

1. **Docker Setup**
Build and run Docker containers:

```sh
make up
```

2. **Destroy Docker containers:**

```sh
make down
```

3. **View logs:**

```sh
make logs
```

4. **Make migrations and migrate the database within Docker (if needed):**
(Migrations have been made and application migrates when it starts up.)

```sh
make docker-makemigrations
make docker-migrate
```

## Using the application

1. **Open the application in your browser:**
   For the FastAPI application OpenAPI docs: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

    To create mock data for the database navigation to the FastAPI application OpenAPI docs and use the `POST /api/seed` endpoint or click on seed data in the FastAPI docs page.

## Tools and Justifications

- **FastAPI**: FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is easy to use, fast to develop with, and provides automatic interactive API documentation.
- **OpenAPI**: OpenAPI is a specification for building APIs. Comes standard with FastAPI.
- **PostgreSQL**: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database management system that is widely used in production environments.
- **SQLAlchemy**: SQLAlchemy is a popular SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. I feel like using an ORM will make it easier to interact with the database and write queries especially for other developers who may not be familiar with SQL.
- **asyncpg**: asyncpg is a fast PostgreSQL database client library for Python. It is designed for use with the async/await syntax and provides support for asynchronous I/O operations.
